update the plan file with a summary of the changes you made. update plan with any new cascading changes, assumptions, updates to the contracts, or differences from the original details included.
if later phases or steps were affected by significant drift in your implementation, then update those phases or steps.
provide any guidance, notes, or feedback that may be useful for the implementer of the remaining phases.
